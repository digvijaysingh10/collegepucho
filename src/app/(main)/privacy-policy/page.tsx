            Please read these Terms fully and carefully before using the

            between you and Giphy for your use of the Services. As described in
            Section 13, you agree that unless you opt out, all disputes between
            you and Giphy will be resolved by individual arbitration, and you
            waive your right to trial by jury, or to participate in a class
            action lawsuit or class-wide arbitration. By using the Services, you
            agree to be bound by these Terms. From time to time, we may modify
            or update these Terms, effective upon posting through the Services.
            If you use the Services after any such change, you accept these
            Terms as modified. In other words: By using anything offered by
            Giphy, you automatically agree to this legal agreement. You also
            accept any updated version of this agreement by continuing to use
            the Services.{" "}
